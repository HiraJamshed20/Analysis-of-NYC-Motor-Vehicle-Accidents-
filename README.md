# Analysis-of-NYC-Motor-Vehicle-Accidents

The project notebook is divided into two deliverables:

Data Cleaning + EDA: cleaning the dataset, filtering the dataset, and plotting trends as part of EDA
Frequent Pattern Mining and Clustering: exploring the power of clustering and frequent pattern mining algorithms to help understand strongly correlated items and easily identify similar characteristics or potential associations among them

The data-set used is also included.

My main contribution was in both of the notebooks, primarily phase 2. A detailed walk-through of the results of the phases is documented in the pdf titled 'Report' and the recommendations drafted can be found in the pdf titled 'Policy Recommendations'.
